### Before the user testing session
- [ ] Create a script for the user testing session.
- [ ] Create a google spreadsheet for all the attendees to take notes. [Example spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uWYxeG52MEjlNhBh4Ap48RC55i67Z9jEsTIhdRhzAR0/edit?gid=772532589#gid=772532589)

### Important notes for the attendees
- [ ] Join the call 5 mins earlier than the scheduled meeting.
- [ ] Do not join the call late.
- [ ] Keep yourself muted during the session.
- [ ] Unmute and ask questions only when the person who is leading the meeting says to the group that they can ask questions. 
- [ ] Do not interrupt.
- [ ] Keep the number of attendees to a reasonable number.

### User testing best practices
