- [ ] Create a script for the user testing session. [Example script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZA2bw9AQOV6pRQuHDxB3Olk8kXOa8fGUXVTaHpnhStk/edit?tab=t.0)
- [ ] Create a google spreadsheet for all the attendees to take notes. [Example spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uWYxeG52MEjlNhBh4Ap48RC55i67Z9jEsTIhdRhzAR0/edit?gid=772532589#gid=772532589)

### Important notes for the attendees
- Join the call 5 mins earlier than the scheduled meeting.
- Do not join the call late.
- Stay muted during the session until the facilitator has asked for additional feedback or questions. 
- Do not interrupt.
- Keep the number of attendees to a reasonable number (2-4 onscreen). If there are more on the call consider turning off your video. 

### Best practices for facilitators
- Welcome users and help them be at ease. 
- Check for shared understanding about the content of the test and invite user questions at any time. 
- Don't ask leading questions to the tester.
- Give time for space around silence to the tester.
- Let the tester take the time to navigate with their AT (Assistive technology)
- Ask for honest feedback. 

### After the Session
- [ ] Download the video from Fable to ensure persistent access.
- [ ] Upload the script, data collection document, and video with dates and other relevant information to the [ITIMS drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-IfbNra0t6LzGzClirPEKBxpLZwl5lD-)
